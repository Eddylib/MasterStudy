#Master Study Project of Eddylib

This project is used to record the coding during the study, building with a standard project structure.The description of detail lie in corresponding directorys.<br>

		`Eigen`
		A subdirectory to learn Eigen ---- a linear algebra c++ library. Now, I'm just at beginning.
		*Initializing of `Matrix` and `Vertex` in matrixAndVertex.cpp.
		*Linear solver to solve equations in linerSolver.cpp.

`Boost`
		A subdirectory to learn Boost ---- a c++ library encapsulates most features of various system.
		*thread.cpp shows codes that depict the features of thread.All work well on Ubuntu 14.04

		`Sophus`
		A library encapsulates opitions of `Lie Group` a wonderful tools to implement robotics movement.
		*Sophusdoc.cpp lists much operations of `Lie Group`.It will be used one day!

		`kalmanFilterMatlab`
		A directory includes some matlab codes.For convenient, I implement `Kalman Filter` with matlab.See details in README.md in `kalmanFilterMatlab` 
		*falseEKF directory lists inchoate code based on othesrs to implement a mouse tracker.
		*mouseTracker directory lists new code reconstructed by me.The README.me is also updated.
